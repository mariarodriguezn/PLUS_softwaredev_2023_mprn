Hi, my name is Felipe Camacho.

I'm a fan of Classic Rock and this time I would like to share with you a verse from the song called "Rock Believer" by Scorpions:

"We go from here to everywhere
So many moments that we share
All boarded up, we give and take
Love came to me so many ways
No matter what some haters say
No one can take our dreams away

Scream for me, screamer
I'm a rock believer like you
Just like you."

(Here is the link to the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TllvFtkXMBE&t=93s)

The flavor I like the most is spicy (but not too spicy), while the food I don't like the most is anything that has celery.

You should watch Interstellar (in case you haven't), a sci-fi movie about a space race to save humankind from extinction. It may be confusing at the beginning, but it's worth it. Moreover, the soundtrack was created by Hans Zimmer. The story is interesting and the space scenarios and physics are based on real scientific papers.

The German word that I use the most is "bezahlen," which means "to pay." I usually use it in restaurants.
